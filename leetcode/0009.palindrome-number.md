# 9 Palindrome Number

<https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/>, Easy

## Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

```
Input: 121
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

## Idea

The first idea is to convert the number to string and check if the string is
palindrome using two pointer `left` and `right`. An optimization can be done for
negative number, because they are not palindrome. The time complexity is O(N)
because the two pointer strategy only iterates the string once.

The second idea is to avoid converting the integer to a string, which is a
time-consuming operation. Instead, we can construct another integer, which is
the reverse of the given one `x`. In the mean time, reduce the length of `x`.
Integer `x` is palindrome if and only if the left-half is symmetric to the
right-half. Be careful about the number of digits: for odd number of digits, `y`
and `x` will never be the same, but `y/10` and `x` will; for even number of
digits, `y` and `x` will be the same at the end. Taken `x=121` and `x=1221` as
examples:

```
(x, y) = (121, 0)
(x, y) = (12, 1)
(x, y) = (1, 12) => OK[x == y/10]
---
(x, y) = (1221, 0)
(x, y) = (122, 1)
(x, y) = (12, 12) => OK[x == y]
```

Other optimization: negative numbers and multiple of 10 (except 0)
are not palindrome.

## Test Cases

- Negative number
- Zero
- Positive number with odd digits
- Positive number with even digits

## Solution

Solution 1: Conversion to string.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        String s = "" + x;
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Solution 2: Reduce digits

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0 || (x > 0 && x % 10 == 0)) {
            return false;
        }
        int y = 0;
        while (x > y) {
            y = 10 * y + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }
        return x == y || x == y / 10;
    }
}
```
