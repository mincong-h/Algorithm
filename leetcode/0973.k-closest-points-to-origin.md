# 973 K Closest Points to Origin

<https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/>, Easy

## Description

We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

Example 1:

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

Note:

- `1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000`
- `-10000 < points[i][0] < 10000`
- `-10000 < points[i][1] < 10000`

## Idea

Sort the points given as input paramter, and return the K smallest ones.
Not sure if it is Leetcode specific, using anonymous class is 50% faster than
using lambda expression.

Another idea is to use a heap to keep the K closest elements.

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

Sort:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        Arrays.sort(points, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] p1, int[] p2) {
                return p1[0] * p1[0] + p1[1] * p1[1] - p2[0] * p2[0] - p2[1] * p2[1];
            }
        });
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(points, 0, K);
    }
}
```

Priority queue (heap):

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        Comparator<int[]> byDistanceDesc = new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] p, int[] q) {
                return (q[0] * q[0] + q[1] * q[1]) - (p[0] * p[0] + p[1] * p[1]);
            }
        };
        Queue<int[]> minPoints = new PriorityQueue<>(byDistanceDesc);
        for (int[] p : points) {
            if (minPoints.size() == K && byDistanceDesc.compare(p, minPoints.peek()) < 0) {
                continue;
            }
            minPoints.add(p);
            if (minPoints.size() > K) {
                minPoints.poll();
            }
        }
        int[][] results = new int[K][2];
        int i = 0;
        for (int[] p : minPoints) {
            results[i++] = p;
        }
        return results;
    }
}
```
