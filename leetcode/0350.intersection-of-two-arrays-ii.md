# 350 Intersection of Two Arrays II

<https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/>, Easy

## Description

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
```

Note:

- Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
- The result can be in any order.

Follow up:

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## Idea

Create a map `m` based on array `nums1`, where key is the number and the value
of the occurrance of that number (count). For each item in array `nums2`, ask
the map if this value exists, if exists, it means that this is part of the
intersection. Decrease the count on that key in the map after the operation.
Assume that there's M elements in `nums1`, and N elements in `nums2`, the
the time complexity is `O(M + N)`.

I used an optimization here, which is to avoid using List but use array
directly.

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums1) {
            int n = m.getOrDefault(num, 0);
            m.put(num, n + 1);
        }
        int i = 0;
        int[] arr = new int[Math.min(nums1.length, nums2.length)];
        for (int num : nums2) {
            int n = m.getOrDefault(num, 0);
            if (n > 0) {
                arr[i++] = num;
                m.put(num, n - 1);
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, 0, i);
    }
}
```
