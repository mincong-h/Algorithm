# 62 Unique Paths

<https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/>, Medium

## Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

Example 2:

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

## Idea

Resolve the problem using dynamic programming (DP), where the solution of the
current cell is the sum of the cell value on the left side and the cell valu on
the top. Before that, an initialization must be done on all cells on the top,
and all cells on the left. All intermedia results are stored in a 2D array.

For example, given m = 7 and n = 3, the array looks like the following:

```
[
  [  1,  1,  1,  1,  1, 1,   1 ],
  [  1,  2,  3,  4,  5, 6,   7 ],
  [  1,  3,  6, 10, 15, 21, 28 ]
]
```

The time complexity of this solution is `O(M*N)` because we only iterate each
element for once. The space complexity is `O(M*N)` too.

## Test Cases

```
(m,n): (1,1)
(m,n): (7,3)
```

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if (m < 1 || n < 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int[][] p = new int[n][m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            p[0][i] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            p[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for (int ni = 1; ni < n; ni++) {
            for (int mi = 1; mi < m; mi++) {
                p[ni][mi] = p[ni][mi - 1] + p[ni - 1][mi];
            }
        }
        return p[n - 1][m - 1];
    }
}
```
