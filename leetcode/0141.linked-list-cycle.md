# 141 Linked List Cycle

<https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/>, Easy

## Description

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Example 1:

- Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
- Output: true
- Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

Example 2:

- Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
- Output: true
- Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

Example 3:

- Input: head = [1], pos = -1
- Output: false
- Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

## Idea

Use two pointer, one fast (2x speed) and one slow (1x speed). The linked list
cycle if and only if at one moment, fast pointer and slow pointer point the same
reference.

## Test Cases

- `head=[3,2,0,-4], pos=1`
- `head=[1], pos=-1`

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
