# 232 Implement Queue Using Stacks

<https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/>, Easy

## Description

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

- `push(x)` -- Push element x to the back of queue.
- `pop()` -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
- `peek()` -- Get the front element.
- `empty()` -- Return whether the queue is empty.

Example:

```java
MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false
```

Notes:

- You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).

## Idea

Use two stacks to implement the queue: one stack for receiving new elements,
and the other stack for offering existing ones. The most important feature of
queue is FIFO (First In First Out), this can be done with two stacks because
when moving elements from one stack to the other, the order of elements will
be changed. For example, given existing elements `[1, 2, 3]`, and new elements
`[4, 5]` to receive, elements can be stored as:

```
  4
  |      ^
  v      |
| 3 |  |   |
| - |  |   |
| 2 |  |   |
| - |  |   |
| 1 |  |   |
+---+  +---+
 in     out
```

```
         1
  |      ^
  v      |
|   |  |   |
|   |  |   |
| 5 |  | 2 |
| - |  | - |
| 4 |  | 3 |
+---+  +---+
 in     out
```

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

```java
class MyQueue {

    private final Stack<Integer> inStack;
    private final Stack<Integer> outStack;

    public MyQueue() {
        inStack = new Stack<>();
        outStack = new Stack<>();
    }

    public void push(int x) {
        inStack.push(x);
    }

    public int pop() {
        if (outStack.empty()) {
            while (!inStack.empty()) {
                outStack.push(inStack.pop());
            }
        }
        return outStack.pop();
    }

    public int peek() {
        if (outStack.empty()) {
            while (!inStack.empty()) {
                outStack.push(inStack.pop());
            }
        }
        return outStack.peek();
    }

    public boolean empty() {
        return inStack.empty() && outStack.empty();
    }
}
```
