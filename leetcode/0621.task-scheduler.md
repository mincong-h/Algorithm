# 621 Task Scheduler

<https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/>, Medium

## Description

Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital
letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks. Tasks could
be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For
each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same
tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or
just be idle.

You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

Example:

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

Note:

1. The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
2. The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

## Idea

Greedy arrangement: always arrange task with the most frequent one first.

with detailed explanation][1].

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] counts = new int[26];
        int maxTypeCount = 0;   // number of task types
        int maxTaskCount = 0;   // number of tasks for each max task type
        for (char task : tasks) {
            counts[task - 'A']++;
            if (maxTaskCount < counts[task - 'A']) {
                maxTaskCount = counts[task - 'A'];
                maxTypeCount = 1;
            } else if (maxTaskCount == counts[task - 'A']) {
                maxTypeCount++;
            }
        }
        int partCount = maxTaskCount - 1;
        int partLength = n + 1 - maxTypeCount;
        int slots = partCount * partLength;
        int availableTasks = tasks.length - maxTypeCount * maxTaskCount;
        int idles = Math.max(0, slots - availableTasks);

        return tasks.length + idles;
    }
}
```
