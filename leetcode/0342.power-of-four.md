# 342 Power of Four

<https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/>, Easy

## Description

Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example 1:

```
Input: 16
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 5
Output: false
```

Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Idea

To solve the problem, we need to understand that number is power of 4 if and
only if:

1. A number is positive
2. A number is power of two
3. But the bit count of n - 1 is even.

Here're some examples:

Number n | Binary n  | n - 1 | Binary n - 1 | Bit Count n - 1
-------: | :-------: | ----: | :----------: | --------------:
       1 | 0000 0001 |     0 | 0000 0000    |               0
       4 | 0000 0100 |     3 | 0000 0011    |               2
      16 | 0001 0000 |    15 | 0000 1111    |               4
      64 | 0100 0000 |    63 | 0011 1111    |               6

"A number is power of two" can be verified by doing an AND operation between n
and n - 1, the result should be zero.

```java
n & (n - 1)
```

Another solution is to optimize the check of condition 3 "bit count of n - 1 is
even" to another condition: "exclude those power of two but not power of
four".

1. A number is positive
2. A number is power of two
3. Exclude those power of two but not power of four

This can be done by using a mask `0x55555555`, to ensure the single 1 bit
always appears at the odd position. This mask is for 32-bit integer, its binary
form is:

```
0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101
```

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

Solution 1:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
        return num > 0
            && (num & (num - 1)) == 0
            && Integer.bitCount(num - 1) % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```

Solution 2:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
        return num > 0
            && (num & (num - 1)) == 0
            && (num & 0x55555555) != 0;
    }
}
```
