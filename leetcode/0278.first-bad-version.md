# 278 First Bad Version

<https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/>, Easy

## Description

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new
product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality
check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the
versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first
bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether
version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should
minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example:

```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

## Idea

The idea is to reduce the range by using binary search. The time complexity is
O(logN).

## Test Cases

```
n = 5, version = 4
n = 2126753390, version = 1702766719
```

## Solution

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int start = 1;
        int end = n;
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        while (start < end) {
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
            mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        }
        return mid;
    }
}
```
