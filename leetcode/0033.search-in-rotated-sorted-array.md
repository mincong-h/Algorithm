# 33 Search in Rotated Sorted Array

<https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/>, Medium

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Idea

The idea is to use binary search to find the target element. We can maintain two
pointers `left` and `right` to keep track of the search range. Since the array
is rotated, it means that only half of the search range is sorted: either the
left half or the right half. This is the first useful condition. The second
useful condition is whether the `target` element is located inside the sorted
range: if yes, reduce the search range to this area; else, reduce the search
range to the opposite area.

## Test Cases

- `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0`
- `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            // right sorted
            if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid;
                }
            } else {
                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return nums[left] == target ? left : -1;
    }
}
```
