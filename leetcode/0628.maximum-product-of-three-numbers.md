# 628 Maximum Product of Three Numbers

<https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-three-numbers/>, Easy

## Description

Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product.

Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24
```

Note:

- The length of the given array will be in range `[3,104]` and all elements are
  in the range `[-1000, 1000]`.
- Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won't exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer.

## Idea

The maximum product can be produced by the 3 biggest positive numbers (PPP) or
by the 2 smallest (negative) numbers combined with the biggest positive number
(NNP). Both cases are possible. In order to find the max product, we need to
compute the two candidates and choose the bigger one.

Idea 1 is to sort the array. Once sorted, the biggest numbers will be located on
the right side, the smallest numbers will be located on the left side. The time
complexity of this solution is O(N log N) because of the sort operation.

Idea 2 is to get the 3 largest numbers and the 2 smallest numbers in one
iteration. This can be done using 5 variables. Once done, compute the two
candidates and choose the bigger one.

## Test Cases

- `[1,2,3,4]`
- `[1,2,3,-4,-5]`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumProduct(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int p1 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[nums.length - 1];
        int p2 = nums[nums.length - 3] * nums[nums.length - 2] * nums[nums.length - 1];
        return p1 > p2 ? p1 : p2;
    }
}
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumProduct(int[] nums) {
        int min1, min2, max1, max2, max3;
        min1 = min2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        max1 = max2 = max3 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > max3) {
                max1 = max2;
                max2 = max3;
                max3 = num;
            } else if (num > max2) {
                max1 = max2;
                max2 = num;
            } else if (num > max1) {
                max1 = num;
            }
            if (num < min1) {
                min2 = min1;
                min1 = num;
            } else if (num < min2) {
                min2 = num;
            }
        }
        int p1 = max1 * max2 * max3;
        int p2 = min1 * min2 * max3;
        return p1 > p2 ? p1 : p2;
    }
}
```
