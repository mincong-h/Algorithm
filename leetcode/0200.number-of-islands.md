# 200 Number of Islands

<https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/>, Medium

## Description

Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of
islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent
lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are
all surrounded by water.

```
Example 1:

Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```

## Idea

Idea is to count island when land detected and sink the island (turn the entire
land into water) to avoid duplicate count.

## Test Cases

- Default test cases
- Empty grid
- Single row grid
- Single column grid
- Single cell grid

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
                if (grid[row][col] == '1') {
                    count++;
                    dfs(grid, row, col);
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int row, int col) {
        if (row < 0 || row >= grid.length || col < 0 || col >= grid[0].length) {
            return;
        }
        if (grid[row][col] == '1') {
            grid[row][col] = '0';
            dfs(grid, row - 1, col);
            dfs(grid, row + 1, col);
            dfs(grid, row, col - 1);
            dfs(grid, row, col + 1);
        }
    }
}
```
