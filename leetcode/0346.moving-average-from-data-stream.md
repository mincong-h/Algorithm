# 346 Moving Average from Data Stream

<https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/>, Easy

## Description

Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Example:

```
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```

## Idea

The idea is to use a queue with limited capacity to maintain the items in
sliding window. The moving average will be then calculated based on the items in
the queue. However, if we calculate the sum of the entire queue for each
`next()` operation, the time complexity will be O(N * S), where N is the number
of times a new value is inserted into the queue, and S is the size of the
sliding windows. In order to optimize this calculation, to be O(N), we can
maintain the sum of the sliding window. Therefore, we can calculate the average
based on `sum` directly. Obviously, we need to update the sum: when the queue
reached its capacity, the oldest one will be removed from the queue and will be
removed from the sum; when a new item is inserted, it will be added to the sum.

## Test Cases

```
["MovingAverage","next","next","next","next"]
[[3],[1],[10],[3],[5]]
```

## Solution

```java
class MovingAverage {

    private final Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    private final int capacity;
    private int sum = 0;

    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        this.capacity = size;
    }

    public double next(int val) {
        if (queue.size() == capacity) {
            int prev = queue.poll();
            sum -= prev;
        }
        queue.add(val);
        sum += val;
        return sum * 1.0 / queue.size();
    }
}
```
