# 2 Add Two Numbers

<https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/>, Medium

## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Idea

Iterate both linked lists at the same time with same speed, until there are no
more nodes on both lists. Store the result of sum on a new linked list. Be
careful about the carry, where the sum of both nodes is greater than or equal to 10.
Also, be aware of the carry coming from the previous sum, that should be taken
into account too. Finally, use a fake list node as the head of result, so that
some corner cases can be handled properly without using if-statement. The time
complexity is O(N).

## Test Cases

```
[2,4,3]
[5,6,4]
```

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        int carry = 0;
        ListNode head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode node = head;
        while (l1 != null || l2 != null) {
            int sum = carry;
            if (l1 != null) {
                sum += l1.val;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            if (l2 != null) {
                sum += l2.val;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            node.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
            node = node.next;
            carry = sum / 10;
        }
        if (carry > 0) {
            node.next = new ListNode(carry);
        }
        return head.next;
    }
}
```
