# 231 Power of Two

<https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/>, Easy

## Description

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:

```
Input: 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
```

Example 3:

```
Input: 218
Output: false
```

## Idea

The 1st idea is to count the number of bit in integer n. A number is power of
two if and only if the number of bit is 1, and it is a positive number.

The 2nd idea is to perform an AND operation between n and n - 1. If n is power
of two, then n - 1 is full of 1 in all the positions lower than the target bit
position of n, their AND must be 0. For example, when n is 8:

```
n           0000 1000
n-1         0000 0111
n & (n-1)   0000 0000
```

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

Solution 1:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return Integer.bitCount(n) == 1 && n > 0;
    }
}
```

Runtime: 1 ms (faster than 92.20%), Memory: 32.4 MB (better than 100.00%)

Solution 2:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
}
```

Runtime: 1 ms (faster than 92.20%), Memory: 32.4 MB (better than 100.00%)
