# 876 Leaf-Similar Trees

<https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/>, Easy

## Description

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

![Tree example](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/16/tree.png)

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

Note:

- Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

## Idea

Create the list of leaf values for both tree. Compare them to be sure that they
are the same.

## Test Cases

```
[3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4]
[3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
```

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean leafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        List<Integer> leaves1 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> leaves2 = new ArrayList<>();
        findLeaves(root1, leaves1);
        findLeaves(root2, leaves2);
        if (leaves1.size() != leaves2.size()) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < leaves1.size(); i++) {
            if (leaves1.get(i) != leaves2.get(i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private void findLeaves(TreeNode root, List<Integer> leaves) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            leaves.add(root.val);
        }
        findLeaves(root.left, leaves);
        findLeaves(root.right, leaves);
    }
}
```
