# 443 String Compression

<https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/>, Easy

## Description

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Example 1:

```
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```

Example 3:

```
Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
```

## Idea

Maintain two pointers `i` and `newStart`, respectively for looking same
characters in the string and handling the string compression. The entire process
is done in 2 loops: outer loop for character `c` and its compression, inner loop
for finding same characters by the following positions. Using two pointer
strategy allows to compress the char array in place.

## Test Cases

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int i = 0;
        int n = chars.length;
        int newStart = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            char c = chars[i];
            int count = 0;
            // find same char
            while (i < n && chars[i] == c) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }
            // compression
            chars[newStart++] = c;
            if (count > 1) {
                String countStr = "" + count;
                for (int j = 0; j < countStr.length(); j++) {
                    chars[newStart++] = countStr.charAt(j);
                }
            }
        }
        return newStart;
    }
}
```
