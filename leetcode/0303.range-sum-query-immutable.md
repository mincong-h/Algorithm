# 303 Range Sum Query - Immutable

<https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/>, Easy

## Description

Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Example:

```
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```

Note:

- You may assume that the array does not change.
- There are many calls to sumRange function.

## Idea

The idea is to calculate the sum from 0 to i during the object instantiation.
Then, when asking about the sum of range i to j, we only calculate the
difference between sum of range 0 to j and the sum of range 0 to i - 1.

## Test Cases

`[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]`

## Solution

```java
class NumArray {

    private int[] sums;

    public NumArray(int[] nums) {
        sums = new int[nums.length];
        if (nums.length > 0) {
            sums[0] = nums[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
                sums[i] = nums[i] + sums[i - 1];
            }
        }
    }

    public int sumRange(int i, int j) {
        return i > 0 ? sums[j] - sums[i - 1] : sums[j];
    }
}
```
