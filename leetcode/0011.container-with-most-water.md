# 11 Container With Most Water

<https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/>, Medium

## Description

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

## Idea

See discussion [Yet another way to see what happens in the O(n) algorithm][d].

## Test Cases

`[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int maxArea = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = height.length - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            int area;
            if (height[i] <= height[j]) {
                area = (j - i) * height[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                area = (j - i) * height[j];
                j--;
            }
            if (maxArea < area) {
                maxArea = area;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```
