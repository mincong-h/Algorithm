# 844 Backspace String Compare

<https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/>, Easy

## Description

Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Example 1:

```
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
```

Example 4:

```
Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
```

Note:

1. 1 <= S.length <= 200
2. 1 <= T.length <= 200
3. S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

## Idea

Normalize both strings and compare them afterwards. The normalization uses a two
pointer strategy, where the right pointer i runs faster to discover new
character, and the left pointer j runs slower to replace the existing characters
whenever a '#' is reached. Be careful, do not go to negative when moving pointer
j.

## Test Cases

- `"ab#c", "ad#c"`
- `"a##c", "#a#c"`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean backspaceCompare(String S, String T) {
        return normalize(S).equals(normalize(T));
    }

    private String normalize(String s) {
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        }
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (arr[i] == '#') {
                i++;
                if (j > 0) {
                    j--;
                }
            } else {
                arr[j] = arr[i];
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }
        return new String(arr, 0, j);
    }
}
```
