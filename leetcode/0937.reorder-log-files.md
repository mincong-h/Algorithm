# 937 Reorder Log Files

<https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-log-files/>, Easy

## Description

You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.

For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier. Then,
either:

- Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
- Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.

We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is
guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log. The
letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the
identifier used in case of ties. The digit-logs should be put in their original
order.

Return the final order of the logs.

Example 1:

```
Input: ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]
```

Note:

- 0 <= logs.length <= 100
- 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
- logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

## Idea

Idea is to split logs into letter-logs and digit-logs and treat (and store) them
differently. For digit-logs, there's nothing to do: they should be put in their
original order. For letter-logs, tokenize each of them into identifier and
content, then perform a sort using the specific order mentioned by the problem:
order lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of
ties. Finally, merge both results into the final one, where letter-logs go
first.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        // Split logs into letter logs and digit logs
        List<String> digitLogs = new ArrayList<>();
        List<String[]> letterLogs = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String log : logs) {
            int pos = log.indexOf(' ');
            String id = log.substring(0, pos);
            String content = log.substring(pos + 1);
            if (isDigitLog(content)) {
                digitLogs.add(log);
            } else {
                letterLogs.add(new String[]{ id, content });
            }
        }
        // sort letter logs
        Comparator<String[]> letterLogComparator = new Comparator<String[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(String[] log1, String[] log2) {
                String id1 = log1[0];
                String id2 = log2[0];
                String content1 = log1[1];
                String content2 = log2[1];

                // both log1 and log2 are letter logs:
                // order lexicographically ignoring identifier
                // with the identifier used in case of ties
                int c = content1.compareTo(content2);
                return c == 0 ? id1.compareTo(id2) : c;
            }
        };
        letterLogs.sort(letterLogComparator);
        // reorder all logs
        String[] arr = new String[logs.length];
        int i = 0;
        for (String[] log : letterLogs) {
            arr[i++] = log[0] + ' ' + log[1];
        }
        for (String log : digitLogs) {
            arr[i++] = log;
        }
        return arr;
    }

    private boolean isDigitLog(String s) {
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c != ' ' && (c < '0' || c > '9')) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
