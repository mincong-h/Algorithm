# 243 Shortest Word Distance

<https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/>, Easy

## Description

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3

Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

## Idea

Iterate words and calculate the distance each time when both positions for word
1 and word 2 are defined. Keep track the shortest distance as `minDistance`.

## Test Cases

- `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], "makes", "coding"`
- `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"], "coding", "practice"`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int shortestDistance(String[] words, String word1, String word2) {
        int minDistance = words.length;
        int pos1 = -1;
        int pos2 = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (word1.equals(words[i])) {
                pos1 = i;
                if (pos2 >= 0) {
                    int d = pos1 - pos2;
                    if (minDistance > d) {
                        minDistance = d;
                    }
                }
            } else if (word2.equals(words[i])) {
                pos2 = i;
                if (pos1 >= 0) {
                    int d = pos2 - pos1;
                    if (minDistance > d) {
                        minDistance = d;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return minDistance;
    }
}
```
