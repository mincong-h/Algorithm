# 66 Plus One

<https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/>, Easy

## Description

Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
```

## Idea

Use a boolean to maintain the carry status. Visit each digits one by one
starting from the last index of the array, until the carry is false. At the end,
if the carry is still valid (true), we need to resize the array, e.g. 99 + 1.
The particularity of "plus one" problem is that, the resized result will always
be 100...000 where the first digit is 1 and all remaining digits are zeros. So
instead of copying the existing array, we can create a new array and change the
value to 1 for position 0.

## Test Cases

- `[1,2,3]`
- `[9,9,9]`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        boolean carry = true;
        int i = digits.length - 1;
        while (carry && i >= 0) {
            if (digits[i] + 1 == 10) {
                digits[i] = 0;
            } else {
                digits[i]++;
                carry = false;
            }
            i--;
        }
        if (carry) {
            int[] results = new int[digits.length + 1];
            results[0] = 1;
            return results;
        } else {
            return digits;
        }
    }
}
```
