# 202 Happy Number

<https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/>, Easy

## Description

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example:

```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1² + 9² = 82
8² + 2² = 68
6² + 8² = 100
1² + 0² + 0² = 1
```

## Idea

Use the reminder of division to create the sum of squares. If the sum created is
greater than or equal to 10, do it recursively. Else, check if it is equal to 1.
In some cases, the calculation is endless. This can be avoided by using result
table to store results that are already done. I chose an boolean array with 10
elements, which correspond to digit 0 to 9.

An optimization can be to pre-calculate the result for digit 0 to 9. So, when
sum reach this zone, the is-happy result is known.

## Test Cases

## Solution

Solution 1:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        return isHappy(n, new boolean[10]);
    }

    private boolean isHappy(int n, boolean[] isDone) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            sum += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
            n /= 10;
        }
        if (sum < 10) {
            if (sum == 1) {
                return true;
            }
            if (isDone[sum]) {
                return false;
            }
            isDone[sum] = true;
        }
        return isHappy(sum, isDone);
    }
}
```

Solution 2:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        boolean[] refs = {
            false, true, false, false, false,
            false, false, true, false, false
        };
        return isHappy(n, refs);
    }

    private boolean isHappy(int n, boolean[] refs) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            sum += (n % 10) * (n % 10);
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum < 10 ? refs[sum] : isHappy(sum, refs);
    }
}
```
