# 133 Clone Graph

<https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/>, Medium

## Description

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep
copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a
list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

Example:

Input

```json
{
  "$id": "1",
  "neighbors": [
    {
      "$id": "2",
      "neighbors": [
        {
          "$ref": "1"
        },
        {
          "$id": "3",
          "neighbors": [
            {
              "$ref": "2"
            },
            {
              "$id": "4",
              "neighbors": [
                {
                  "$ref": "3"
                },
                {
                  "$ref": "1"
                }
              ],
              "val": 4
            }
          ],
          "val": 3
        }
      ],
      "val": 2
    },
    {
      "$ref": "4"
    }
  ],
  "val": 1
}
```

Explanation:

- Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
- Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
- Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
- Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.

Note:

1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
2. The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
3. Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
4. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

## Idea

Idea is to maintain a map for mappings between old reference and new reference.
Then, split the deep clone into two separated steps: clone the object itself,
and update the neighbor nodes afterwards. Since it's a graph, we need to do this
clone in recursion: clone the object before resursion, and update neighhor
references after resurcion.

## Test Cases

Default test cases

## Solution

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        Map<Node, Node> oldNewMappings = new HashMap<>();
        return cloneGraph(node, oldNewMappings);
    }

    private Node cloneGraph(Node node, Map<Node, Node> oldNewMappings) {
        // clone
        Node newNode = new Node(node.val, node.neighbors);
        oldNewMappings.put(node, newNode);
        // resursive clone
        for (Node oldNeighbor : node.neighbors) {
            if (!oldNewMappings.containsKey(oldNeighbor)) {
                cloneGraph(oldNeighbor, oldNewMappings);
            }
        }
        // update neighbors
        List<Node> newNeighbors = new ArrayList<>(node.neighbors.size());
        for (Node oldNeighbor : node.neighbors) {
            newNeighbors.add(oldNewMappings.get(oldNeighbor));
        }
        newNode.neighbors = newNeighbors;
        return newNode;
    }
}
```
