# 1002 Find Common Characters

<https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/>, Easy

## Description

Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
```

Note:

1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 100`
3. `A[i][j]` is a lowercase letter

## Idea

The problem can be resolved by using a reference table, which contains the
number of occurrance of each character in common. Each time a word in `A` is
visited, we count the nummber of occurrance of each char. Once done, compare it
with the reference table, and update it if necessary. Two choices are possible
for the reference table: hash map (or any other hash container), or an integer
array. I choose array here, because `java.util.HashMap`: 1. use array
internally; 2. need auto-boxing `int` to `Integer`; 3. has a more complex
mechanism for calculating the hash; 4. use more memory.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> commonChars(String[] A) {
        int[] refs = new int[26];
        for (char c : A[0].toCharArray()) {
            refs[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < A.length; i++) {
            int[] arr = new int[26];
            for (char c : A[i].toCharArray()) {
                arr[c - 'a']++;
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                if (refs[j] > arr[j]) {
                    refs[j] = arr[j];
                }
            }
        }
        List<String> results = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < refs[i]; j++) {
                results.add("" + (char) ('a' + i));
            }
        }
        return results;
    }
}
```
