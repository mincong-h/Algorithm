# 58 Length of Last Word

<https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/>, Easy

## Description

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

Example:

```
Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

## Idea

The idea is to walk through the string from right to left.

1. Walk until the character is not a space, where it is also the end position of
   the last word.
2. Walk until the character is a space (again), where it is also the start
   position of the last word.

Corner case: the last word does not exist. In other words, no word in the
string, only spaces if any.

## Test Cases

- "`Hello World`"
- "`Hello World `" (tailing spaces)
- "` `" (only spaces)

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int i = s.length() - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) == ' ') {
            i--;
        }
        // last word does not exist
        if (i < 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int len = 0;
        while (i >=0 && s.charAt(i) != ' ') {
            i--;
            len++;
        }
        return len;
    }
}
```
