# 388 Longest Absolute File Path

<https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-absolute-file-path/>, Medium

## Description

Suppose we abstract our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext" represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains an empty sub-directory `subdir1` and a
sub-directory `subdir2` containing a file file.ext.

The string
`"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains two sub-directories `subdir1` and `subdir2`.
`subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and an empty second-level sub-directory
`subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a second-level sub-directory `subsubdir2`
containing a file `file2.ext`.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path
to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the
longest absolute path is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`, and its length
is `32` (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the
length of the longest absolute path to file in the abstracted file system. If
there is no file in the system, return `0`.

Note:

- The name of a file contains at least a `.` and an extension.
- The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a `.`.

Time complexity required: `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the input string.

Notice that `a/aa/aaa/file1.txt` is not the longest file path, if there is
another path `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png`.

## Idea

- Keep all parent directories in a stack, where the bottom of the stack is the
  root directory, and the top of the stack is the direct parent of the file.
- Only calculate the file path when the current path is a regular file.
- A regular file contains at least one dot (`.`).
- Use two pointers `start` and `end` to visit each line. So that the parsing can
  be faster than using `String#split`.
- In the entire method, use format `/path/to/file` to represent absolute path,
  and remove the leading slash when about to return the result.
- The last line might not end with new line `\n`.
- The current level can be calculated based on the number of tabs (`\t`).

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
        Stack<String> dirnames = new Stack<>();
        int maxLen = 1;
        int parentLen = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int end = input.indexOf('\n');
        if (end < 0) {
            end = input.length();
        }
        while (end > start) {
            String line = input.substring(start, end);
            boolean isFile = line.lastIndexOf('.') >= 0;
            int pos = line.lastIndexOf('\t');
            int level = pos + 2;
            // adjust parent dirnames
            while (dirnames.size() >= level) {
                parentLen -= (dirnames.pop().length() + 1);
            }
            if (isFile) {
                // process and update path
                String filename = line.substring(pos + 1);
                int len = parentLen + 1 + filename.length();
                if (maxLen < len) {
                    maxLen = len;
                }
            } else {
                // save current dir in dirnames
                String dirname = line.substring(pos + 1);
                dirnames.add(dirname);
                parentLen += (dirname.length() + 1);
            }
            // next line
            start = end + 1;
            end = input.indexOf('\n', end + 1);
            if (end < 0) {
                end = input.length();
            }
        }
        return maxLen - 1;
    }
}
```
