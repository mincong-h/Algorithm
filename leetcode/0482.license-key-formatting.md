# 482 License Key Formatting

<https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/>, Easy

## Description

You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

Example 1:

```
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

Output: "2-5G-3J"

Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```

Note:

1. The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.
2. String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).
3. String S is non-empty.

## Idea

Create a new string by visiting S in reverse order, and reverse the target
string when finished. During the visit, skip the dash ('-'), make lowercase
upper. For improving performance, a char array is used here. All the
manipulication is done in the array, without the need to construct any
intermediate string. A dash is added to the array at the end of each section
(length K). At the end, the array is reversed manually. The initial capacity of
the array is the length of S plus some extra exspaces: they are reserved for
eventual dashes. For example, when `S="aaaa", K=4`, the output is `aa-aa`.

## Test Cases

- `"-", 2` No letter to format
- `"aaaa", 2` The output string is longer than the input
- `"aa-aa", 2` Tailing dash (implementation specific)
- `"5F3Z-2e-9-w", 4` Official input with lower case
- `"2-5g-3-J", 2` Official input with dash rearrange

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String S, int K) {
        char[] arr = new char[S.length() + S.length() / K];
        int pos = 0;
        for (int i = S.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            char c = S.charAt(i);
            if ('a' <= c && c <= 'z') {
                arr[pos++] = (char)(c - 'a' + 'A');
            } else if (c != '-') {
                arr[pos++] = c;
            }
            if ((pos + 1) % (K + 1) == 0) {
                arr[pos++] = '-';
            }
        }
        int end = pos > 0 && arr[pos - 1] == '-' ? pos - 2 : pos - 1;
        if (end < 0) {
            return "";
        }
        for (int i = 0, j = end; i < j; i++, j--) {
            char c = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = c;
        }
        return new String(arr, 0, end + 1);
    }
}
```
