# 237 Delete Node in a Linked List

<https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/>, Easy

## Description

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/28/237_example.png)

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

Note:

- The linked list will have at least two elements.
- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
- Do not return anything from your function.

## Idea

Replace the value of the current node by the value of the next node, and remove
the next node from the linked list:

```
Before:  N1{3} -> N2{4} -> N3{5}
After:   N1{4} -> N3{5}
```

Because there are several constraints here:

- The head of the ListNode is not part of the input parameter. Therefore, when
  doing the removal, we need to ensure that node N1 is still reacheable after
  the operation.
- "Deleting a node" does not mean delete the target list node instance in the
  program. It means delete the value, represented by the node. In other words,
  we only need to ensure the serialization form is correct.

## Test Cases

- `[4,5,1,9], 5`

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        ListNode next = node.next;
        node.next = next.next;
        node.val = next.val;
    }
}
```
