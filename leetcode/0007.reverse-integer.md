# 7 Reverse Integer

<https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/>, Easy

## Description

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```

Example 2:

```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```

Example 3:

```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```

Note:

Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within
the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2<sup>31</sup>,  2<sup>31</sup> − 1]. For the
purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed
integer overflows.

## Idea

This can be done by deviding integer `x` by 10 and take the reminder to
multiple by 10, until `x` becomes 0. For example, reversing x=123 can be done as
follows:

```
(x, rev): (123, 0)
(x, rev): (12, 3)
(x, rev): (1, 32)
(x, rev): (0, 321)
```

However, we need to be extremely careful about the overflow problem, where we
need to return 0. Overflow can be detected by doing division on the new result,
computed by multiplication: if the results are different on both sides, than it
is overflow:

    (newrev - reminder) / 10 != rev

The solution works for negative numbers, too. Because reminder can be negative.

## Test Cases

- 123
- -123

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        int rev = 0;
        while (x != 0) {
            int reminder = x % 10;
            int newrev = rev * 10 + reminder;
            if ((newrev - reminder) / 10 != rev) {
                return 0; // overflow
            }
            rev = newrev;
            x /= 10;
        }
        return rev;
    }
}
```
