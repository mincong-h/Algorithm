# 225 Implement Stack using Queues

<https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/>, Easy

## Description

Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.

- `push(x)` -- Push element x onto stack.
- `pop()` -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
- `top()` -- Get the top element.
- `empty()` -- Return whether the stack is empty.

Example:

```java
MyStack stack = new MyStack();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.top();   // returns 2
stack.pop();   // returns 2
stack.empty(); // returns false
```

Notes:

- You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).

## Idea

Use one queue to implement the stack. When a new element is pushed, re-order the
queue so that it has the stack order. This is done by changing N - 1 elements in
the queue.

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

```java
class MyStack {

    private final Queue<Integer> queue;

    public MyStack() {
        queue = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public void push(int x) {
        queue.add(x);
        for (int i = 0; i < queue.size() - 1; i++) {
            queue.add(queue.poll());
        }
    }

    public int pop() {
        return queue.poll();
    }

    public int top() {
        return queue.peek();
    }

    public boolean empty() {
        return queue.isEmpty();
    }
}
```
