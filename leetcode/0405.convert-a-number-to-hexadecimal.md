# 405 Convert a Number to Hexadecimal

<https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal/>, Easy

## Description

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:

1. All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
4. You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

Example 1:

```
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
```

## Idea

Construct the string char by char, starting from the end (lowest digits). Each
time we process the last 4 digits of the number `num` by using a mask
(`0b1111`). Then, continue the process by shifting the digits to the right
four-by-four. The processing takes the last 4 digits and create a char.
The created char is stored in the char array. Finally, use the char array to
create the string, after filtering the leading zeros.

## Test Cases

- 26
- 0

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String toHex(int num) {
        char[] chars = new char[]{ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' };
        for (int i = chars.length - 1; i >= 0 && num != 0; i--) {
            chars[i] = "0123456789abcdef".charAt(num & 15);
            num >>>= 4;
        }
        int pos = 0;
        while (pos < 7 && chars[pos] == '0') {
            pos++;
        }
        return new String(chars, pos, chars.length - pos);
    }
}
```
