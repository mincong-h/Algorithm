# 543 Diameter of Binary Tree

<https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/>, Easy

## Description

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree

```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \
      4   5
```

Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. 

## Idea

Recursively compute the diameter and the depth of each tree node. The depth of a
tree node is straight forward: it is the max depth between left child node depth
and the right child node depth, plus one. The diameter of a tree node is more
complicated to calculate: it is the max value between 3 values - the diameter of
the left child node, the diameter of the right child, and the diameter of the
current node (root node). Both diameter and depth are returned as result, they
are stored in an array:

```java
return new int[] { diameter, depth };
```

This is an O(N) solution because the traversal is done only once from bottom to
top.

## Test Cases

`[1,2,3,4,5]`

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        return root == null ? 0 : diameterAndDepth(root)[0] - 1;
    }

    private int[] diameterAndDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new int[] {0, 0};
        }
        int[] ddLeft = diameterAndDepth(root.left);
        int[] ddRight = diameterAndDepth(root.right);
        int diameterLeft = ddLeft[0];
        int diameterRight = ddRight[0];
        int diameterRoot = 1 + ddLeft[1] + ddRight[1];
        int diameter = Math.max(Math.max(diameterLeft, diameterRight), diameterRoot);
        int depth = Math.max(ddLeft[1], ddRight[1]) + 1;
        return new int[] { diameter, depth };
    }
}
```
