# 114 Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

<https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/>, Medium

## Description

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:

```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

## Idea

Idea is to handle the flattening in a recursive approach by using
depth-first-search (DFS), so that the tree can be visited in pre-order. When
doing DFS, use a utility method `flattenAndGetTail` to return the tail of new
structure, which will make the recursion easier. The time complexity is O(N)
since each node is visited once.

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        flattenAndGetTail(root);
    }

    private TreeNode flattenAndGetTail(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return root;
        }
        TreeNode left = root.left;
        TreeNode right = root.right;
        TreeNode leftTail = flattenAndGetTail(left);
        TreeNode rightTail = flattenAndGetTail(right);
        if (leftTail == null) { // right only
            return rightTail;
        }
        if (rightTail == null) { // left only
            root.left = null;
            root.right = left;
            return leftTail;
        }
        // left and right
        root.left = null;
        root.right = left;
        leftTail.right = right;
        return rightTail;
    }
}
```
