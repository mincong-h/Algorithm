# 771 Jewels and Stones

<https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/>, Easy

## Description

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

Note:

- S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
- The characters in J are distinct.

## Idea

Idea is create a table for jewels based on string J, and iterate string S to
count the number of jewels. Querying the table is based on index, so the time
complexity is linear. Iterating string S is O(N), where N is the length of
string S.

## Test Cases

```
"z"
"ZZ"
```

```
"aA"
"aAAbbbb"
```

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        boolean[] isJewel = new boolean[128];
        for (char c : J.toCharArray()) {
            isJewel[c] = true;
        }
        int n = 0;
        for (char c : S.toCharArray()) {
            if (isJewel[c]) {
                n++;
            }
        }
        return n;
    }
}
```
