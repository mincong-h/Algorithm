# 236 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

<https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/>, Medium

## Description

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

Note:

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

## Idea

The method return the LCA if found. The idea is to extend the definition of the
method, and use it for recursion.

- When root is null, return null
- When both p and q are found under tree, return LCA
- When only p is found under the tree, return p
- When only q is found under the tree, return q
- When p and q are not found under the tree, return null

Using the above definition, we can delegate the method LCA to both left child
node and right child node (and do it recursively). If a result is found for both
sides, it means the current root is the solution. Else, use either left or
right. The recursion stops when reaching the leave (root == null), when root is
p, or when root is q.

## Test Cases

- `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1`
- `root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4`

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null || root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        return left != null && right != null ? root : (left == null ? right : left);
    }
}
```
