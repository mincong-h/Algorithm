# 138 Copy List with Random Pointer

<https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/>, Medium

## Description

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random
pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/static_assets/discuss/uploads/files/1470150906153-2yxeznm.png)

```
Input:
{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
```

Note:

1. You must return the copy of the given head as a reference to the cloned list.


## Idea

Visit the entire list to copy node one-by-one, also store the old-new node
mapping in a map. It allows to keep a mapping for both `next` and `random`
references. Once done, visite the entire list the 2nd time, and change the
`next` and `random` reference of each node in the new list. The time complexity
is O(N) because we visite the list twice. The space complexity is O(N) because
each node has one mapping in the map.

## Solution

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node next;
    public Node random;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _next,Node _random) {
        val = _val;
        next = _next;
        random = _random;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        Map<Node, Node> nodeMap = new HashMap<>();
        Node oldNode = head;
        while (oldNode != null) {
            Node newNode = new Node();
            newNode.val = oldNode.val;
            nodeMap.put(oldNode, newNode);
            oldNode = oldNode.next;
        }
        Node newHead = nodeMap.get(head);
        Node newNode = newHead;
        oldNode = head;
        while (oldNode != null) {
            if (oldNode.next != null) {
                newNode.next = nodeMap.get(oldNode.next);
            }
            if (oldNode.random != null) {
                newNode.random = nodeMap.get(oldNode.random);
            }
            oldNode = oldNode.next;
            newNode = newNode.next;
        }
        return newHead;
    }
}
```
