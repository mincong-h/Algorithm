# 40 Combination Sum II

<https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/>, Medium

## Description

Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note:

- All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example 1:

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:

```
[
  [1, 7],
  [1, 2, 5],
  [2, 6],
  [1, 1, 6]
]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5,
A solution set is:
[
  [1,2,2],
  [5]
]
```

## Idea

Use backtracking strategy. Construct the solutions by using different candidates
in the array, and reduce the target until it becomes zero. The pending solution
`path` keeps track of candidates that are already be taken from range `0` to
position `pos` (exclusive). Do it recursively, but each time, it's only allowed
to take the remaining candidates from range `pos` to the end.

Note that each candidate can only be taken once in the solution, and there are
duplicates in candidates. It might lead to duplicate solutions. In order to
avoid such situation, we sort the candidates first. Then during the recursion,
if the neighbour candidate on the left side was not chosen, skip the current
one. In other words, only use the first candidate when several ones haing the
same value.

## Test Cases

- `[10,1,2,6,5,1,5]`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum2(int[] candidates, int target) {
        if (candidates == null || candidates.length == 0) {
            return Collections.emptyList();
        }
        LinkedList<Integer> path = new LinkedList<>();
        List<List<Integer>> results = new LinkedList<>();
        Arrays.sort(candidates);
        dfs(candidates, path, 0, target, results);
        return results;
    }

    private void dfs(int[] candidates, LinkedList<Integer> path, int pos,
                    int target, List<List<Integer>> results) {
        if (target < 0) {
            return;
        }
        if (target == 0) {
            results.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
            return;
        }
        for (int i = pos; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            if (i == pos || candidates[i] != candidates[i - 1]) {
                path.add(candidates[i]);
                dfs(candidates, path, i + 1, target - candidates[i], results);
                path.removeLast();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
