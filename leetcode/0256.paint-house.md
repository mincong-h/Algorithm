# 256 Paint House

<https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/>, Easy

## Description

There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3
cost matrix. For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house 0 with
color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

```
Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
```

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[][] costs) {
        int[] minCosts = { 0, 0, 0 };
        int minCost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.length; i++) {
            int[] arr = new int[] {
                Math.min(minCosts[1], minCosts[2]) + costs[i][0],
                Math.min(minCosts[0], minCosts[2]) + costs[i][1],
                Math.min(minCosts[0], minCosts[1]) + costs[i][2]
            };
            minCost = Math.min(Math.min(arr[0], arr[1]), arr[2]);
            minCosts = arr;
        }
        return minCost;
    }
}
```
