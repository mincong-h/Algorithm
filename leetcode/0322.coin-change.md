# 322 Coin Change

<https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/>, Medium

## Description

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money
amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to
make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any
combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:

```
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Idea

Using dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum steps to do, in
order to reach each amount `a` between \[0, amount\]. Then, return the result at
the index "amount" (base-0). For each step, it is unreachable by default (-1),
but it will become reachable when a previous step is reachable and the distance
between two steps (previous, current) is one coin. The time complexity of this
solution is `O(C * A)` where C is the number of coins, and A is the amount. The
space complexity is `O(A)`.

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] steps = new int[amount + 1];
        int a = amount;
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            int stepI = -1;
            for (int coin : coins) {
                int prev = i - coin;
                if (prev >= 0 && steps[prev] >= 0) {
                    if (stepI < 0) {
                        stepI = steps[prev] + 1;
                    } else {
                        stepI = Math.min(stepI, steps[prev] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
            steps[i] = stepI;
        }
        return steps[amount];
    }
}
```
