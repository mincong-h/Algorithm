# 461 Hamming Distance

<https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/>, Easy

## Description

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 2<sup>31</sup>.

Example:

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

## Idea

Perform an XOR operation on integer x and y, so that we can see all positions
which are different. This result is stored as `diff`. Then, count the number of
bit in diff using logical right shift (`>>>`). Note that I'm not using
arithmetic right shift (`>>`) here, because we should not keep the sign bit.

## Test Cases

```
(x,y)=(1,2)
(x,y)=(1,3)
```

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int diff = x ^ y;
        int distance = 0;
        while (diff != 0) {
            if ((diff & 1) == 1) {
                distance++;
            }
            diff = diff >>> 1;
        }
        return distance;
    }
}
```
