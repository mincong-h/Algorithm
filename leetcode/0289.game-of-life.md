# 289 Game of Life

<https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/>, Medium

## Description

According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as
Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton
Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or
dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical,
diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia
article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board
given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules
simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths
occur simultaneously.

Example:

```
Input:
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

Follow up:

1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at
   the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated
   values to update other cells.
2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the
   board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area
   encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

## Idea

The idea is to update the board using the 4 rules described, in other words,
compute the next state based on the current state and the states of its
neighbors. In order to solve it in-place, we need to find a way to represent
both the current state and the next state, because all the cells need to be
updated simultaneously. This can be done using a 2 bits strategy, the higher bit
for the next state, and the lower bit for the current state:

Next  | Current | Bits
:---: | :-----: | :---:
0     | 0       | 00
0     | 1       | 01
1     | 0       | 10
1     | 1       | 11

This strategy allows us to enrich the board without allocating new space. Once
all cells updated using 2 bits, the second step is to replace the current state
by the new state. The time complexity is O(mn), and the space complexity is
O(1).

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    private static final int LIVE = 1;

    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        if (board.length == 0) {
            return;
        }
        // complex state (next & curr)
        for (int row = 0; row < board.length; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < board[0].length; col++) {
                board[row][col] = nextState(board, row, col);
            }
        }
        // simple state (next)
        for (int row = 0; row < board.length; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < board[0].length; col++) {
                board[row][col] = board[row][col] / 2;
            }
        }
    }

    private int nextState(int[][] board, int row, int col) {
        int live = 0;
        int width = board[0].length;
        int height = board.length;
        // horizontal
        if (row > 0 && (board[row - 1][col] & 1) == LIVE) live++;
        if (row < height - 1 && (board[row + 1][col] & 1) == LIVE) live++;
        // vertical
        if (col > 0 && (board[row][col - 1] & 1) == LIVE) live++;
        if (col < width - 1 && (board[row][col + 1] & 1) == LIVE) live++;
        // diagonal
        if (row > 0 && col > 0 && (board[row - 1][col - 1] & 1) == LIVE) live++;
        if (row > 0 && col < width - 1 && (board[row - 1][col + 1] & 1) == LIVE) live++;
        if (row < height - 1 && col > 0 && (board[row + 1][col - 1] & 1) == LIVE) live++;
        if (row < height - 1 && col < width - 1 && (board[row + 1][col + 1] & 1) == LIVE) live++;

        int currState = board[row][col];
        int nextState;
        if (currState == LIVE) {
            nextState = live == 2 || live == 3 ? 1 : 0;
        } else {
            nextState = live == 3 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        return nextState * 2 + currState;
    }
}
```
