# 35 Search Insert Position

<https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/>, Easy

## Description

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:

```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4
```

Example 4:

```
Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0
```

## Idea

This problem can be solve using a binary search, where we define two boundaries
`left` and `right`, and always read the value at the middle position of the
array. Then, compare the read value with target, either return or shorten the
boundaries. Boundaries themselves are eventual valid solutions, so we continue
the lookup ~until~ after the boundaries collapse. Binary search is an O(log N)
solution.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int pos = (left + right) / 2;
            if (target == nums[pos]) {
                return pos;
            }
            if (target < nums[pos]) {
                right = pos - 1;
            } else {
                left = pos + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
