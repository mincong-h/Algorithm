# 139 Word Break

<https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/>, Medium

## Description

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of
non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated
sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the
  segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
```

## Idea

Use dynamic programming (DP) to know if a word can be segmented. We will iterate
all characters of string s, at each position i, check if it can be segmented
using the dictionary. It can be segmented if and only if a previous position can
be segmented, and the characters between `prev` and `curr` position is an actual
word. The base case is that an empty string (0 character) can be segmented.

## Test Cases

Default test cases

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[s.length() + 1];
        dp[0] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            for (String word : wordDict) {
                if (dp[i]) {
                    break;
                }
                int prev = i - word.length();
                if (prev >= 0) {
                    String segment = s.substring(prev, i);
                    if (segment.equals(word) && dp[prev]) {
                        dp[i] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[s.length()];
    }
}
```
