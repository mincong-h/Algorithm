# 238 Product of Array Except Self

<https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/>, Medium

## Description

Given an array `nums` of n integers where n > 1,  return an array `output` such
that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except
`nums[i]`.

Example:

```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:

Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

## Idea

Create two intermediate arrays for storing products at each position i: one
called "L" for storing the product of range 0 to i - 1, the other called "R" for
storing the product of range i + 1 to N - 1. Then, use the product of both
arrays to produce the final results. Here's an example using input
`[1, 2, 3, 4]`:

```
Input:  [ 1,  2, 3, 4]
L:      [ 1,  1, 2, 6]
R:      [24, 12, 4, 1]
Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
```

It is also possible to solve it with constant space complexity (without counting
the output as extra space). The idea is to use array `results` to store the
results of array L and array R. For array L, it is the same approach as the
previous solution; for array R, we need to create a new variable `product` for
storing the product of range i + 1 to N - 1, and keep it evolved. Detail can be
seen in the source code.

## Test Cases

- `[1,2]`
- `[1,2,3,4]`

## Solution

Solution 1:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] L = new int[n];
        int[] R = new int[n];
        L[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            L[i] = L[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        R[n - 1] = 1;
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            R[i] = R[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
        }
        int[] P = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            P[i] = L[i] * R[i];
        }
        return P;
    }
}
```

Solution 2:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] results = new int[nums.length];
        results[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            results[i] = results[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        int product = 1;
        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            product *= nums[i + 1];
            results[i] *= product;
        }
        return results;
    }
}
```
