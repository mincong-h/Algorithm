# 916 Word Subsets

<https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/>, Medium

## Description

We are given two arrays A and B of words.  Each word is a string of lowercase letters.

Now, say that word b is a subset of word a if every letter in b occurs in a, including multiplicity.  For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior", but is not a subset of "world".

Now say a word a from A is universal if for every b in B, b is a subset of a.

Return a list of all universal words in A.  You can return the words in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","oo"]
Output: ["facebook","google"]
```

Example 4:

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["lo","eo"]
Output: ["google","leetcode"]
```

Example 5:

```
Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["ec","oc","ceo"]
Output: ["facebook","leetcode"]
```

Note:

1. `1 <= A.length, B.length <= 10000`
2. `1 <= A[i].length, B[i].length <= 10`
3. `A[i]` and `B[i]` consist only of lowercase letters.
4. All words in `A[i]` are unique: there isn't `i != j` with `A[i] == A[j]`.

## Idea

Create a hash table `refs` to store criteria for each character. A word is a "subset"
if and only if the number of occurrences of every character in word is less than
or equal to the number in hash table `refs`. Since there are only lower-case
characters, so 26 of them, we can use a 26-length int array as hash table. Once
created, iterate array `A` to find the subset words.

## Test Cases

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> wordSubsets(String[] A, String[] B) {
        // Create hash table for items in B
        int[] refs = new int[26];
        for (String b : B) {
            int[] temp = new int[26];
            for (char c : b.toCharArray()) {
                temp[c - 'a']++;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (refs[i] < temp[i]) {
                    refs[i] = temp[i];
                }
            }
        }
        // Check items in A to ensure they are subset of B
        List<String> results = new LinkedList<>();
        word: for (String a : A) {
            int[] arr = new int[26];
            for (char c : a.toCharArray()) {
                arr[c - 'a']++;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (arr[i] < refs[i]) {
                    continue word;
                }
            }
            results.add(a);
        }
        return results;
    }
}
```
