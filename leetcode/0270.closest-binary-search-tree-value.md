# 270 Closest Binary Search Tree Value

<https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/>, Easy

## Description

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Note:

- Given target value is a floating point.
- You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Example:

Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286

```
    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

Output: 4
```

## Idea

Use the characteristic of BST, where right child has value greater than root,
and left child has value less than root. Since the target is a double, we need
to compute the different for two candidates, the closest on its left side, and
the closest on its right side.

## Test Cases

- `root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286`

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int closestValue(TreeNode root, double target) {
        double rdiff = Math.abs(root.val - target);
        if (root.val < target) {
            if (root.right != null) {
                int v = closestValue(root.right, target);
                double cdiff = Math.abs(v - target);
                return cdiff < rdiff ? v : root.val;
            }
        } else if (root.val > target) {
            if (root.left != null) {
                int v = closestValue(root.left, target);
                double cdiff = Math.abs(v - target);
                return cdiff < rdiff ? v : root.val;
            }
        }
        return root.val;
    }
}
```
