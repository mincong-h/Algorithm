# 392 Is Subsequence

<https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/>, Medium

## Description

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:

s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.

## Idea

Check each character of string s in string t, starting from different position.

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int pos = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            int idx = t.indexOf(c, pos);
            if (idx < pos) {
                return false;
            }
            pos = idx + 1;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
