# 108 Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

<https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/>,
Easy

## Description

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

```
      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

## Idea

Divide the tasks (array) into 3 parts: left, middle, and right. Left part can be
done by creating a left sub-tree, middle part can be done by create a tree node,
right part can be done by creating a right sub-tree.

## Test Cases

- `[-10,-3,0,5,9]`

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        return newTree(nums, 0, nums.length);
    }

    private TreeNode newTree(int[] nums, int leftInclusive, int rightExclusive) {
        if (leftInclusive >= rightExclusive) {
            return null;
        }

        int mid = (leftInclusive + rightExclusive) / 2;
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        root.left = newTree(nums, leftInclusive, mid);
        root.right = newTree(nums, mid + 1, rightExclusive);
        return root;
    }
}
```
