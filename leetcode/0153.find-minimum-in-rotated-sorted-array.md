# 153 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

<https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/>, Medium

## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

## Idea

Find the minimum value using a custom binary search. In the rotated sorted
array, the min value is located somewhere on the rotated side (left / right):

              *--* right side rotated
    [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
           ^
          mid

By reducing the gap between left and right (either increase left or decrease
right), we will find the middle value at the end. The time complexity is O(log
N).

## Test Cases

- `[3,4,5,1,2]`
- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            // right side rotated
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
}
```
