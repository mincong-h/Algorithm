# 64 Minimum Path Sum

<https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/>, Medium

## Description

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:

```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

## Idea

The idea is to create another 2D array `minSum` for storing the minimum sum for
arriving at each position (m, n). The time complexity of this solution is
`O(N)`. Note that there is a corner case to handle when the grid is empty.

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int M = grid.length;
        int N = grid[0].length;
        int[][] minSum = new int[M][N];

        // row 0
        minSum[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        for (int n = 1; n < N; n++) {
            minSum[0][n] = grid[0][n] + minSum[0][n - 1];
        }

        // row 1+
        for (int m = 1; m < M; m++) {
            minSum[m][0] = grid[m][0] + minSum[m - 1][0];
            for (int n = 1; n < N; n++) {
                int min = Math.min(minSum[m][n - 1], minSum[m - 1][n]);
                minSum[m][n] = grid[m][n] + min;
            }
        }
        return minSum[M - 1][N - 1];
    }
}
```
