# 234 Palinfrome Linked List

<https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/>, Easy

## Description

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

Example 1:

```
Input: 1->2
Output: false
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true
```

Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

## Idea

In order to determine if it is a palindrome, we need to compare the left half of
the linked list with the right half. The middle position can be determined using
two-pointer strategy. More detail will be explained later. Once the position is
known, move forward on the right part and move backward on the left part in the
same time. The list is palindrome if and only if both parts have identical nodes
(value and length).

Determination of the middle position is done using two pointers: `slow` and
`fast`. Pointer `fast` moves 2 steps while pointer `slow` moves 1 step.
Therefore, when `fast` reaches the end, `slow` reaches the middle. More
precisely, assume that both pointers start at node 0: when the size of the list
is odd, the fast pointer stops at the end node `N-1` (base 0) and the slow
pointer stops at middle `(N-1)/2`; when the size of the list is even, the fast
pointer stops after the end node `N-1` (so `null`) and the slow pointer stops at
middle `N/2`. Based on different these situations, the right part start from the
next node or the node itself.

```
odd:   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null
                 ^         ^
                Slow      Fast

even:  1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> null
                 ^         ^
                Slow      Fast
```

Meanwhile, we need another variable `prev` to help reversing the left part of
the linked list. Therefore, the comparison of left (L) / right (R) part of the
list can be done successfully.

```
odd:   1 <- 2   3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null
                ^         ^
               Slow      Fast

even:  1 <- 2   2 -> 1 -> null
                ^         ^
               Slow      Fast
```

The time complexity is O(N), and the space complexity is O(1).

## Test Cases

- Even number of nodes: `1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1`
- odd number of nodes: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            ListNode next = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow.next = prev;
            prev = slow;
            slow = next;
        }

        ListNode R = fast == null ? slow : slow.next;
        ListNode L = prev;
        while (R != null && L != null) {
            if (R.val != L.val) {
                return false;
            }
            R = R.next;
            L = L.next;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
