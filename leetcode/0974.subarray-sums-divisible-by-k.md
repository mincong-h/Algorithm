# 974 Subarray Sums Divisible by K

<https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/>, Medium

## Description

Given an array A of integers, return the number of (contiguous, non-empty)
subarrays that have a sum divisible by K.

Example 1:

```
Input: A = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], K = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by K = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]
```

Note:

- `1 <= A.length <= 30000`
- `-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000`
- `2 <= K <= 10000`

## Idea

LeetCode discussion [Clean O(n) Number Theory + Prefix Sums][1] by Eddie
Carrillo.

[1]: https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/discuss/217962/Java-Clean-O(n)-Number-Theory-%2B-Prefix-Sums

1. Calculate the prefix sum at each position i.
2. Store number of prefix sums having the remainder r in array `remainder`.
3. Calculate the number of subarray using the remainder array.

A subarray `[start, end]` is divisible by K if and only if they have the same
remainder:

    prefixSum[start] % K == prefixSum[end] % K

Therefore, if we want to find subarray divisible by K, we can find pairs where
start and end have the same reminder. For each remainder, the number of
combinations are calculated as `C(n, 2)`:

    combinations = (n * (n-1)) / 2

For remainder 0, they don't necessarily need to be paired. So they can be
considered as single-item solution as well.

## Test Cases

Default test case

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int subarraysDivByK(int[] A, int K) {
        int reminders[] = new int[K];
        int sum = 0;
        for (int a : A) {
            sum += a;
            int i = sum % K;
            if (i < 0) {
                reminders[i + K]++;
            } else {
                reminders[i]++;
            }
        }
        int total = reminders[0];
        for (int count : reminders) {
            if (count > 1) {
                total += (count * (count - 1)) / 2;
            }
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```
