# 693 Binary Number with Alternating Bits

<https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-number-with-alternating-bits/>, Easy

## Description

Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.

Example 1:

```
Input: 5
Output: True
Explanation:
The binary representation of 5 is: 101
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 7
Output: False
Explanation:
The binary representation of 7 is: 111.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: 11
Output: False
Explanation:
The binary representation of 11 is: 1011.
```

Example 4:

```
Input: 10
Output: True
Explanation:
The binary representation of 10 is: 1010.
```

## Idea

Idea 1 is to check the bits two-by-two. If it respects the pattern `01`
everywhere, n is number with alternating bits. The check is done by right
shifting the bits two-by-two (`>>> 2`) until n becomes 0. However, there's a
corner case where n start with a tailing 0, in which case we shift right 1 bit
first.

Idea 2 is to use the specialty of a number with alternating bits, where the XOR
of n and n >> 1 are all 1-bits. This can be used as a caracteristic to determine
whether n is with alternating bits. See [LeetCode Discussion: Java super simple
explanation with inline
example](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-number-with-alternating-bits/discuss/113933).

```
n =         1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
n >> 1      0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
n ^ n>>1    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
n           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
n + 1     1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
n & (n+1)   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

Idea 1:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
        if ((n & 1) == 0) {
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        while (n != 0) {
            if ((n & 3) != 1) {
                return false;
            }
            n = n >>> 2;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Idea 2:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
        n = n ^ (n>>1);
        return (n & n+1) == 0;
    }
}
```
