# 311 Sparse Matrix Multiplication

<https://leetcode.com/problems/sparse-matrix-multiplication/>, Medium

## Description

Given two sparse matrices A and B, return the result of AB.

You may assume that A's column number is equal to B's row number.

Example:

```
Input:

A = [
  [ 1, 0, 0],
  [-1, 0, 3]
]

B = [
  [ 7, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 1 ]
]

Output:

     |  1 0 0 |   | 7 0 0 |   |  7 0 0 |
AB = | -1 0 3 | x | 0 0 0 | = | -7 0 3 |
                  | 0 0 1 |
```

## Idea

First of all, we need to understand how matrix multiplication works... Each row
in matrix A is considered as a vector, each column in matrix B is also
considered as a vector. The sum of mupltiplications between vector A and vector
B, is the value of cell (row, column) in result matrix. Here's an illustration
from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication):

![Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Matrix_multiplication_diagram_2.svg/1280px-Matrix_multiplication_diagram_2.svg.png)

We iterate vector A and vector B at the same speed and
calculate the multiplication of item A (row, i) and B (i, column).
The speciality of the question L311, is that the matrix is sparse. We want to
skip the calculation when a cell is 0, which improves the performance.

## Test Cases

```
[[1,0,0],[-1,0,3]]
[[7,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
```

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] multiply(int[][] A, int[][] B) {
        int height = A.length;
        int width = B.length == 0 ? 0 : B[0].length;
        int vLen = A.length == 0 ? 0 : A[0].length;
        int[][] matrix = new int[height][width];

        for (int h = 0; h < height; h++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < vLen; i++) {
                if (A[h][i] != 0) {
                    for (int w = 0; w < width; w++) {
                        matrix[h][w] += A[h][i] * B[i][w];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return matrix;
    }
}
```
