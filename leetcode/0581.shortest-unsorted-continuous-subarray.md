# 581 Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray

<https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/>, Easy

## Description

Given an integer array, you need to find one continuous subarray that if you only sort this subarray in ascending order, then the whole array will be sorted in ascending order, too.

You need to find the shortest such subarray and output its length.

Example 1:

```
Input: [2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]
Output: 5
Explanation: You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the whole array sorted in ascending order.
```

Note:

- Then length of the input array is in range [1, 10,000].
- The input array may contain duplicates, so ascending order here means <=.

## Idea

The idea is to make a copy and sort the array. Then use a two pointer strategy
to keep track of well positioned items from the left side and the right side.
The remaining part is the shortest subaarray. The time complexity is O(N *
log(N)).

## Test Cases

```
[2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]
[2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15,-1]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findUnsortedSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int[] sorted = Arrays.copyOf(nums, nums.length);
        Arrays.sort(sorted);
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length - 1;
        while (l < nums.length && nums[l] == sorted[l]) {
            l++;
        }
        while (r > l && nums[r] == sorted[r]) {
            r--;
        }
        return r + 1 - l;
    }
}
```
