# 344 Reverse String

<https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/>, Easy

## Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array
of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example 1:

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Idea

Using two pointers i and j starting from the beginning and the end of the
string, then switch characters in these two positions.

## Test Cases

- Built-in example

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = s.length - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            char c = s[i];
            s[i] = s[j];
            s[j] = c;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
}
```
