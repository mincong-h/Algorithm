# 110 Balanced Binary Tree

<https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/>, Level

## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

> a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example 1:

Given the following tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Return true.

Example 2:

Given the following tree `[1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]`:

```
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
```

Return false.

## Idea

A binary tree node is balanced if and only if the two following conditions are
satisfied:

1. Depth of the two subtrees of current node never differ by more than 1.
2. The two subtrees are both balanced them selves.

Here, I implemented a bottom-top solution by using the "magic" of integer: if
the integer is positive or zero, it represents the depth of the tree; else, it
represents the un-balanced status of the tree. This implementation uses a
depth-first-search (DFS) approach.

## Test Cases

None

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        int d = dfs(root);
        return d != -1;
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int l = dfs(root.left);
        if (l == -1) {
            return -1;
        }

        int r = dfs(root.right);
        if (r == -1) {
            return -1;
        }

        if (Math.abs(l - r) > 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        return 1 + Math.max(l, r);
    }
}
```
