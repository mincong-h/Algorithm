# 1013 Partition Array Into Three Parts With Equal Sum

Easy

## Description

Given an array A of integers, return true if and only if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.

Formally, we can partition the array if we can find indexes `i+1 < j` with
`(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i] == A[i+1] + A[i+2] + ... + A[j-1] == A[j] + A[j-1] +
... + A[A.length - 1])`

Example 1:

```
Input: [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: 0 + 2 + 1 = -6 + 6 - 7 + 9 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1]
Output: false
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4]
Output: true
Explanation: 3 + 3 = 6 = 5 - 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 - 9 + 4
```

## Idea

Calculate the sum of all elements, then divide by three. If no reminder, it
means that it might be possible to partition the array. Now, use a two pointers
strategy to visit the array from both sides: left and right. Sum them separately
as `sum1` and `sum3`. If these pointers do not collapse, it means that there's a
solution.

## Test Cases

- `[0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1]`
- `[0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1]`
- `[3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4]`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canThreePartsEqualSum(int[] A) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int a : A) {
            sum += a;
        }
        if (sum % 3 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        int avg = sum / 3;
        int sum1 = 0;
        int sum3 = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = A.length - 1;
        while (i < A.length && sum1 != avg) {
            sum1 += A[i++];
        }
        while (j >= 0 && sum3 != avg) {
            sum3 += A[j--];
        }
        return i <= j;
    }
}
```
