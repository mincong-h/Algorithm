# 56 Merge Intervals

<https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/>, Medium

## Description

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

## Idea

Sort the input intervals and merge one interval with the previous one if
overlapped. Overlapping occurs when the start index of the new interval is
between the start index (inclusive) and the and end index (inclusive) of the
previous interval. The time complexity is O(N log N), because of the sort
operation.

## Test Cases

- Built-in test cases

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] merge(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) {
            return new int[0][0];
        }
        Comparator<int[]> byStartThenEnd = new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] i1, int[] i2) {
                return i1[0] != i2[0] ? i1[0] - i2[0] : i1[1] - i2[1];
            }
        };
        Arrays.sort(intervals, byStartThenEnd);
        int[][] results = new int[intervals.length][intervals[0].length];
        int idx = 0;
        results[0] = intervals[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            // overlap: start between prevStart & prevEnd
            if (results[idx][0] <= intervals[i][0] && intervals[i][0] <= results[idx][1]) {
                results[idx][1] = Math.max(intervals[i][1], results[idx][1]);
            } else {
                results[++idx] = intervals[i];
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOf(results, idx + 1);
    }
}
```
