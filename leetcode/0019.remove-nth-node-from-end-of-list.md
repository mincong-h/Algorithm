# 19 Remove Nth Node From End of List

<https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/>, Medium

## Description

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its
head.

Example:

```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

Note:

Given n will always be valid.

## Idea

Use two pointers: start and end to solve the problem. Both pointers will move
with the same speed, but they will not start at the same time. Pointer "start"
will moving n steps first, then "end" pointer moves with "start". Therefore,
the offset between them is the distance `n` provided by the input. It will help
us to remove the Nth node from the end. However, in single linked list, you
cannot remove a node by positioning one pointer on that node, because it only
contains reference to its next node and does not contain reference to the
previous node. Therefore, use `beforeEnd` instead of `end`. Also, it is possible
that the method remove the head of the list. So we should create a dummy head to
support this case. I call it `beforeHead`.

## Test Cases

```
list: [1,2,3,4,5], k: 2   // default test case
list: [1,2,3,4,5], k: 5   // remove head
```

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode beforeHead = new ListNode(0);
        beforeHead.next = head;
        ListNode start = beforeHead;
        ListNode beforeEnd = beforeHead;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            start = start.next;
        }
        while (start != null) {
            start = start.next;
            beforeEnd = beforeEnd.next;
        }
        beforeEnd.next = beforeEnd.next.next;
        return beforeHead.next;
    }
}
```
