# 332 Reconstruct Itinerary

<https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/>, Medium

## Description

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival
airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets
belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:

1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary
   that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For
   example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than
   ["JFK", "LGB"].
2. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

Example 1:

```
Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.
```

## Idea

Store all the tickets as candidates in a map, where the key is the "from"
airport and the value is a queue of airports (use priority queue here to
guarantee the lexical order). Then, construct the itinerary starting from "JFK"
by visiting all candidates. Note that the visit will get stuck at some moment,
because we hit the exit. Once exit reached, we go backward to construct the
entire solution. For more detail, see dicussion [Short Ruby / Python / Java /
C++](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/discuss/78768/Short-Ruby-Python-Java-C%2B%2B).

## Test Cases

```
[["JFK","KUL"],["JFK","NRT"],["NRT","JFK"]]
[["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
[["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
```

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> findItinerary(List<List<String>> tickets) {
        Map<String, Queue<String>> candidates = new HashMap<>();
        for (List<String> t : tickets) {
            candidates.computeIfAbsent(t.get(0), k -> new PriorityQueue<>()).add(t.get(1));
        }
        LinkedList<String> itinerary = new LinkedList<>();
        visit("JFK", candidates, itinerary);
        return itinerary;
    }

    private void visit(String airport, Map<String, Queue<String>> candidates, LinkedList<String> itinerary) {
        while (candidates.containsKey(airport) && !candidates.get(airport).isEmpty()) {
            visit(candidates.get(airport).poll(), candidates, itinerary);
        }
        itinerary.addFirst(airport);
    }
}
```
