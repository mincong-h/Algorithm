## HackerRank

Too lazy to add :see_no_evil:

## Techniques

### Array

**Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm.** Finding a majority element that occurs
≥ N/2 times. Done in O(N) runtime and O(1) space. See
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm>.

### Linked List

**2 pointers.** One slow pointer (1x speed) and one fast pointer (2x speed). It
allows to resolve circular issue, because the faster one will be 1 round faster
after some moves.

## Check

TreeNode:

- Can `root` be `null`?
